Personal website to showcase projects

Description
-----------
This is a personal website was designed to be on a single page with no front end frameworks or back end server. 
The simple architecture was selected based on the static nature of the content. 
The Sass architecture was adapted from a quick tutorial who used components as a best practice. Given the limited 4 page nature of the website and my lack of experience with SASS, this the SASS architecture was reconfigured to pages. The SASS files retain redundant code with has not been refactored.
